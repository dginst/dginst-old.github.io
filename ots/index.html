    A timestamp proves that some data existed prior to some point in time.
    The <a href="www.opentimestamps.org">OpenTimestamps</a> protocol defines
    an open standard consisting in a set of operations for creating provable
    blockchain timestamps and later independently verifying them.
</p>
<p>
    An OpenTimestamps <em>calendar</em> server provides aggregation of multiple
    documents allowing to timestamp all of them at the same time using just a
    single blockchain transaction.
    Moreover, a calendar server can offer its services to multiple remote
    OpenTimestamps clients.
    While anyone could realize a timestamp with the permissionless
    blockchain(s) by paying the transaction fees, OpenTimestamps public servers
    are free to use without any registration or API key.
</p>
<p>
    While the OpenTimestamps protocol is blockchain agnostic,
    a timestamp is as reliable as the used blockchain:
    <ul>
        <li>
            very reliable when used with the bitcoin's blockchain
            because that chain is secured by huge
            computational power (<em>proof-of-work</em>);
        </li>
        <li>
            much less reliable with other public permissionless chain;
        </li>
        <li>
            when used with private permissioned blockchain its reliability
            depends on the reliability of the chain governance: in that case
            traditional certification authorities are probably better.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    This webpage is an interface to create timestamp proofs using the
    facilities provided by the OpenTimestamps public free bitcoin calendar
    servers: Bitcoin's blockchain is used as a timestamp notary, i.e. the proof
    is attested in a Bitcoin block header.<br>
    Timestamps can be verified independently using a local
    <a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/"">Bitcoin Core</a>
    node; anyway, since a web-page cannot access the local filesystem,
    this page relies on public blockexplorers for verification.
</p>
<p>
    It should be obvious, but it is worth mentioning that time-stamping
    (using the OpenTimestamps protocol or any alternative approach):
    <ul>
        <li>
        does not prove authorship (that should be provided using a
        digital signature);
        </li>
        <li>
        does not ensure veracity of the timestamped document.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
